An interior architecture student (Hannah), two professors, and I worked together for 7 months to create this virtual reality tour that immerses users in the 1950's Magnolia House.

On January 11 2021, I sent an email to a professor, saying I was interested in working with him on this project. He asked me to create a traffic system in Unity as an assessment. I installed Unity for the first time and programmed a traffic system on a small level. The professor liked what I made and we started working together on the Magnolia House VR project. 

## Project Requirements
- 3D model of the house and immersive audio
- Navigate in virtual reality with teleportation
- Quit the application through a menu
- Run on Meta Quest 2

## What I Did
After meeting with the client and understanding the project, Hannah and I started working.
While Hannah was modeling the house, I started working on the virtual reality part.

### Virtual Reality

I used the Oculus Integration plugin to create virtual reality controls.
